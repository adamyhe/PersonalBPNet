# Porting the original TensorFlow CLIPNET weights

See [installation](installation.md) first — this requires the `tf` extra (`pip install "personalbpnet[tf]"` or `uv sync --extra tf`).

`CLIPNET_TF` is a faithful port of the original TensorFlow `rnn_v10` CLIPNET architecture to PyTorch — a genuinely different architecture from the [PyTorch `CLIPNET`](clipnet.md) (uses MaxPool, ELU, 1000 bp input → 500 bp output, two-hot encoded inputs). The `from_tf` class method loads hdf5 weights directly into a PyTorch module, without requiring TensorFlow to be installed.

```python
import os

from personal_bpnet import CLIPNET_TF

os.makedirs("clipnet_models/", exist_ok=True)
for i in range(1, 10):
    os.system(f"wget https://zenodo.org/records/10408623/files/fold_{i}.h5 -P clipnet_models/")

models = [CLIPNET_TF.from_tf(f"clipnet_models/fold_{i}.h5") for i in range(1, 10)]
```

These models expect inputs of shape `(N, 4, 1000)`. **IMPORTANT:** models loaded this way still expect inputs to be two-hot encoded (see the description in the [TensorFlow CLIPNET README](https://github.com/Danko-Lab/clipnet/blob/main/README.md)). For compatibility with packages that only allow one-hot encoded sequences, use the `TwoHotToOneHot` wrapper:

```python
from personal_bpnet import TwoHotToOneHot

ohe_models = [TwoHotToOneHot(m) for m in models]
```

This works for all models trained using the `rnn_v10` architecture in the [original CLIPNET repo](https://github.com/Danko-Lab/clipnet/blob/main/clipnet/rnn_v10.py). At present, this includes:

- the original [LCL PRO-cap models](https://zenodo.org/records/10408623),
- [K562 PRO-cap models](https://zenodo.org/records/14037356) (fine-tuned from the above),
- [ablated LCL PRO-cap models](https://zenodo.org/records/14037356).

For a full worked example, see the [Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/Danko-Lab/clipnet/blob/main/clipnet_basic_tutorial.ipynb) from the original TensorFlow CLIPNET repo.
